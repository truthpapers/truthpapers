                <h2>
                    In the name of God
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All praises and thanks be to God alone, the wise, the just, the creator of everything. He, the most
                    high, sent His messengers and prophets to guide humanity towards Monotheism, which is to single Him
                    out with worship.
                    And to tell us what the purpose of life is. God said: And I did not create the jinns and humans
                    except to worship Me. Quran 51:56 And He, the most high, said: And We certainly sent into every
                    nation a messenger, [saying], "Worship God and avoid Taghut (Taghut: Anything worshipped other than
                    God.)" Quran 16:36.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The Arabs of Quraish believed in monotheism in the sense that God alone created everything,
                    nevertheless they were polytheists. That is because they worshipped, besides God, dead saints.
                    God said about them that they say: "These (whom we ask help from and worship) are our intercessors
                    with God" Quran 10:18.

                </p>
                <p>
                    All kinds of worship<sup>1</sup> must be for God alone. So, asking Jesus or “saints” for help is
                    polytheism.
                    God said: And indeed, We sent Nuh (Noah) to his people (and he said): "I have come to you as a plain
                    warner. That you worship none but God, surely, I fear for you the punishment of a painful Day.”
                    Quran 11:25-26.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The Messenger of God was asked by angel Jibrael (Gabriel): What is the belief (required to become
                    Muslim)? God’s Messenger replied: “The belief is 1- to believe in God, 2- His angels, 3- His Books,
                    4- His Messengers (e.g., Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad), 5- Day of Resurrection (Judgement),
                    and 6- Al-Qadar (what God has ordained must come to pass).
                    He then was asked: what is Islam? God’s Messenger replied: “To single out God with worship, 2- to
                    perform Salah (five daily prayers), 3- to pay Zaka (obligatory charity), 4- to observe fasting
                    during the month of Ramadan, and 5- Hajj<sup>2</sup>” Source: Sahih Al-Bukhari.

                <p>
                    Note: It is prohibited in Islam to build over graves of ‘saints’ or prophets, to have their graves
                    inside a mosque, to pilgrim or travel to their graves or shrines, to make statues of them, to
                    picture them, to hang their pictures, or to worship and supplicate God inside their
                    shrines.<sup>3</sup>
